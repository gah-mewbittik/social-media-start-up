# Social-Media-Start-Up

## Building the Back End of a Social Media Start-up

The purpose of this project is to create the backend of a social media application. The Social Media Start-Up is designed to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)in the backend of a social media application. CRUD was implemented with the User and Thought Models. For the friends and reactions, the only required methods were POST and Delete. Developing this project demonstrates our ability to use MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and Insomnia for testing.
